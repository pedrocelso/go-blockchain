# Go Blockchain

### What is this repo?
I'm using this code to create a basic blockchain implementation. There's a lot of things that I want to learn and get used on the blockchain ecosystem, and I'm pretty confident that GO can offer a great way to implement those things.
Mostly I'm basing my code on different tutorials that I've seen on internet.
